                <h1>Article: <span>Learning the basics of TypeScript</span></h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                <p>I have been hearing about the term TypeScript for a while now. Apparently,
                    all the cool guys use it while I still have no clue what TypeScript is and why
                    it should be better than regular JavaScript.
                    About a week ago I had a job interview for an internship at <a
                        href="https://www.wearetriple.com/">Triple</a>,
                    they asked me if I knew how to code in TypeScript and Sass. I had to tell them that I was aware it
                    existed
                    but that I hadn’t looked into it yet. Since I still had to write an article, it seemed like a good
                    opportunity to dive
                    into typescript and write this article about the basics. </p>

                <h3>Tutorial</h3>
                <p>I followed a course on TypeScript made by The Net Ninja which is my biggest resource in writing this
                    article.
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI">Link to the
                        tutorial.</a>
                </p>

                <h3>Why TypeScript?</h3>
                <p>Typescript is an extension to JavaScript. This means that TS (TypeScript) can do all the same things
                    JS (JavaScript)
                    can but it comes with new features and syntax. One of these features is strict types, which means
                    that if you declare
                    a variable to be a string, you cannot change it later on into a number or a Boolean for example.
                    This helps us with
                    validating our code to see if it is working correctly and it helps us to write cleaner code. Another
                    feature is that
                    it supports modern JS features like arrow functions, let and const and, when we compile our TS code
                    into JS code,
                    we have the option to choose for an older version of JavaScript so it comes compatible with all
                    browsers.
                    This is similar to ‘Babel’ if you ever worked with this compiler.
                </p>

                <h3>Installing TypeScript</h3>
                <p>You can install TypeScript by using NPM.
                    <code>npm install -g typescript</code>
                </p>
                <p>And that is it! You have already installed TypeScript.
                    To start, we create a file with a .ts extension and to show you the basics,
                    I will create a file called basics.ts
                </p>

                <h3>How to compile to JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Browsers do not understand the TS syntax and this reason,
                    we need to compile our TypeScript into JavaScript.
                    We do this using our terminal, personally, I always use my terminal in
                    VSCode but that depends on your IDE. Before we start compiling,
                    I added some code to my basics.ts file so there is actually something to compile.
                    The code I added is:
                    <code>let myName = 'Nathan';</code>
                    <code>console.log(myName)</code>
                </p>


                <p>
                    To compile, open your terminal and write the following:
                    <code>tsc basics.ts</code>
                    However, if you want your javascript file to be named differently than your TS file you can write
                    both names in the terminal like this:
                    <code>tsc basics.ts otherfilename.js</code>
                    These commands compile your TS code into the JS code which you can use in the browser.
                </p>

                <p>There is one more thing to know:
                    At the moment, you will have to write this every time you want to compile your code.
                    But, if you want to compile your code automatically every time you save your file, you can add a
                    watch mode
                    <code class="inline">-w</code>
                    in the command like this:
                    <code>tsc basics.ts -w</code>
                </p>

                <h3>Strict type basics</h3>
                <p>The main difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is that TS uses strict types and JS does not.
                    This means that if you define a variable as a string, you can’t change it into a number or Boolean
                    or even an object later on.
                </p>

                <h4>Variables</h4>
                <p>So in my example file, I defined a variable with my name. Because we are Using TS, this means that
                    this variable is
                    now defined as a string and therefore can’t be changed into a number for example;
                    <code>let myName = 'Nathan';</code>
                    <code>myName = 30;</code>
                </p>

                <p>This doesn’t work, but what does that mean? Well, it means that I will get a red line below the
                    change saying that the type of number can’t be assigned to variable that has been assigned a string
                    type. And when I save my file that automatically tries to compile the file, it gives me an error
                    explaining what caused the error. This, for example, gets very handy when you work with numbers. I
                    have made this error multiple times while fetching an API and thinking I would receive an object
                    with a value of a number, which then turns out the be a string. TS helps you to find this error
                    beforehand.
                    <code>let myAge= '30';</code>
                    <code>myAge = 31;</code>
                </p>

                <h4>Functions</h4>
                <p>This also works with functions, to explain this I will create a function that returns my age times
                    two.
                    <code>const double = (myAge) =&gt; { return myAge * 2 } </code>
                </p>
                <p>If I pass in a string it doesn’t give me an error because TypeScript doesn’t know yet that only a
                    number can be passed in. We can change that by adding <code class="inline">: number</code> to it. So
                    the function is as followed;
                    <code>const double = (myAge: number) =&gt; { return myAge * 2 } </code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    If I would pass in a string now,
                    it would give me the error because it expects an number now.
                    <code>console.log(double('30')) // =&gt; NaN -&gt; Error in TS with myAge: number</code>
                    <code>console.log(double(30)) // =&gt; 60</code>
                </p>

                <p>So now TS allows us to type check during development which leads to cleaner code and fewer errors in
                    the browser according to The Net Ninja. </p>

                <h4>Arrays</h4>
                <p>Arrays have a strict type as well. If, for example, you had an array with strings in it, you won’t be
                    able to add a new value to that array if it isn’t a string. To demonstrate this, I created an array
                    with names and tried to push in a new name and a number.
                    <code>
                    <code>let names = ['Nathan', 'Sander', 'Annabel'];</code>
                    <code>names.push('Wilmer') // =&gt; Wilmer gets added to the array</code>
                    <code>names.push(3000) // ERROR =&gt; Cannot push a number into an array with type string.</code>
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>If you create an array with different types, however, you will be able to add these types in later.
                    So, for example, if I have an array with strings and numbers, I am able to add new strings and
                    numbers but I won’t be able to add an Boolean.
                     </p>

                <h4>Objects</h4>
                <p>When using objects in TS you need to know that the object properties have strict types. So if I
                    create an object about myself with my name, age and relation status, each property will have a type.
                    So in this object, my name will be a string, age will be a number and my relation status will be a
                    Boolean.
                    <code>
                    <code>let nathan = {</code>
                    <code class="indent">name: 'Nathan', // => type string</code>
                    <code class="indent">age: 30, // => type number</code>
                    <code class="indent">relation: true // => type Boolean</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>When updating this object, all properties would have to be the same type. I wouldn’t be able to
                    change my age to <code class="inline">’30’</code> because of its specific type. </p>

                <h4>To conclude</h4>
                <p>TypeScript’s main feature is strict types which let you assign a type to a variable, function, array
                    or object. When a type is assigned, it cannot be changed into another type afterwards. Because of
                    this, we write cleaner code that is less prone to errors in the browser. One of the reasons we get
                    fewer errors in the browser is because we get the error while compiling. It forces us to fix these
                    error before it lets us compile the TS file into JavaScript. But the errors we get while compiling
                    help us solve it as well.</p>

                <h3>Explicit types</h3>
                <p>Currently, when we write a variable, the type of that variable is automatically set. But we can set
                    variables without giving them a value. To assign a type to a variable without a value we explicitly
                    have to give this variable a type. It looks like this;
                    <code>
                        <code>let myName: string;</code>
                    <code>let myAge: number;</code>
                    <code>let relation: boolean;</code>
                    </code>
                </p>

                </code></pre>
                <p>Now as before, I must assign a string to myName and a number to myAge.
                    Arrays however are a bit more complicated. You can still assign a type to an array like this for
                    example:
                    <code>let names: string[];</code>
                </p>
                <p>Trying to push any other type than a string will result in an error. But if you push a string to this
                    variable you also get an error in the browser. This is because the variable is not initialized yet.
                    You have to initialize the array by giving it a value of an empty array like you would when you
                    declare a variable as an array. So the correct syntax would be:
                    <code>let names: string[] = [];</code>
                </p>
                <p>But in some cases, you might need more than one type in an array. You can do this by using a union
                    type.
                     </p>


                <h4>Union type</h4>
                <p>With a union type, you set the type to be one of two or one of three types. So when I have an array
                    called mixed and I want it to be able to contain strings and numbers I would define this variable as
                    a union type like this:
                    <code>let mixed: (string | number)[] = [];</code>
                </p>

                <p>Within the parentheses you declare the types that are allowed inside the array divided by a pipe
                    (vertical slash). When you declare a union type that is not an array, like a normal variable, you
                    don’t have to use the parentheses. The correct syntax would be;
                    <code>let mixedVariable: string | number;</code>
                </p>

                <h4>Explicit object type</h4>
                <p>You can also set the type of a variable to an object without giving the variable a direct value. For
                    example, I can say that <code class="inline">let nathan</code> is going to be an object before
                    adding its value by:
                    <code>let nathan: object;</code>
                </p>

                <p>But you can go one step further in setting strict values for an object. I could say that
                    <code class="inline">let nathan</code> is going to be an object with three properties called name,
                    age and relation with a set type for each. This would look like this:
                    <code>
                    <code>let nathan: {</code>
                    <code class="indent">name: string,</code>
                    <code class="indent">age: number,</code>
                    <code class="indent">relation: boolean</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Now if I would say <code class="inline">nathan = { }</code> this would get an error although it’s an
                    object. It would need the three properties as defined above. </p>

                <h4>Type: any</h4>
                <p>There is one more type that we haven’t covered yet, and that is the any type. This means that we can
                    assign any value to it, string, number or Boolean, and we can even give it a default value. Below
                    here is an example of this:
                    <code>let remarks: any = 25;</code>
                </p>
                <p>The remarks variable can be any type and for now, it has the value of the number 25. But the remarks
                    variable isn’t of the number type. Later on, you could say
                    <code class="inline">remarks = ‘nice weather today’;</code> and it would be accepted. Be careful
                    using this type
                    because it basically makes your TypeScript variable into a JavaScript variable where you lose the
                    benefits of TypeScript. Apart from using the any type for a variable, it can be used for arrays,
                    objects and functions as well.
                </p>

                <h3 id="function-type">Function type</h3>
                <p>Just like declaring a value to a variable that will set its type, you can also assign a function to a
                    variable. To show this I created a function that console logs <code
                        class="inline">hello world</code>.
                    <code>
                    <code>let greet = () => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log('hello world')</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>When I would assign a string to this variable <code class="inline">greet = ‘hello’;</code> it would
                    give me an
                    error. Just as with other explicit types you can explicitly set a variable type to function and
                    assign the function later on to the variable like this:
                    <code>
                    <code>let greet: Function;</code>
                    <code>greet = () => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log('hello world')</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>it’s also possible to assign the types to parameters in a function. To showcase this, I created a
                    function that has two parameters. Since this is a small piece of math, it will require numbers and
                    not strings or Booleans. So in declaring this function I should assign types to the parameters like
                    this:
                    <code>
                    <code>const add = (a: number, b: number) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">return a + b;</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Giving a parameter a union type is possible as well, you can even make a parameter optional. At the
                    moment parameters <code class="inline">a</code> and <code class="inline">b</code> are required,
                    without these, you will get an
                    error. But what if you would like to add an optional parameter? Well, you can do this by adding a
                    question mark like this:
                    <code>
                    <code>const add = (a: number, b: number, c?: number | string) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">return a + b;</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log(c)</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>It is custom to declare all required arguments first and all optional arguments at the end.
                    Otherwise, all the arguments get mixed up, and we want to keep our code clean, remember? </p>
                <p>If you don’t pass in any value for <code class="inline">c</code> when declaring this function, it
                    returns as
                    <code class="inline">undefined</code>. But you can also assign a default value for this parameter
                    this way. Because
                    of it’s default value you can’t use the question mark any longer to make this parameter optional.

                    <code>
                    <code>const add = (a: number, b: number, c: number | string = 10) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">return a + b;</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log(c)</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>As often, our function <code class="inline">add</code> returns a value. When we declare this function
                    in a variable
                    like below, TypeScript can infer the type that is being returned by the function and sets it as the
                    type of the variable. So in the example below, the variable <code class="inline">result</code> will
                    have a type of
                    a number because it is the returned value of our function <code class="inline">add</code>.
                    <code>let result = (add(10, 4)); // => type: number</code>
                </p>
                <p>You can also explicitly declare the return type of a function. You do this by adding a colon after
                    the function parentheses like in the example below. Now you don’t need to do this, because
                    TypeScript is automatically inferring the return type, but you might choose to do so when you have a
                    larger function and want to show that it will return a number at a glance. It does increase the
                    readability of your function.
                    <code>
                    <code>const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">return a + b;</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Our function returns a value of a number but what if a function doesn’t return anything? Well, then
                    it returns a <code>void</code> value. So instead of return a + b we now return a console log, the
                    return value of this function is of the type void.
                    <code>
                    <code>const add = (a: number, b: number) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log(a + b)</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Void is a complete lack of any value. In JavaScript this would return undefined but in TypeScript
                    they created a difference between undefined and returning no values, which become void. </p>

                <h4>Type alias</h4>
                <p>Working with functions and specifying the types of the parameters can produce a very long string.
                    Sometimes, these parameters are the same for other functions and the result is a duplicate of a very
                    long string. Below you will see an example of two functions that require the same parameters. Notice
                    how long both parameters are while they are just a duplicate of one another.
                    <code>
                    <code>const sayHello = (user: {name: string, uid: string | number }) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log('hello')</code>
                    <code>}</code>

                    <code>const sayGoodbye = (user: {name: string, uid: string | number }) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log('bye bye')</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Another, more clean way of writing this, is by using Type Aliases. You can define the type as
                    follows:
                    <code>type StringOrNum = string | number;</code>
                </p>
                <p>You can also nest types into each other. So in our case of the duplicate functions, we would want to
                    define the type of the object like this:
                    <code>type objWithName = { name: string, uid: StringOrNum}</code>
                </p>
                <p>Defining these two types makes both functions a lot shorter. You can add these Type Aliases to the
                    function parameters like this:
                    <code>
                    <code>const sayHello = (user: objWithName) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log('hello')</code>
                    <code>}</code>

                    <code>const sayGoodbye = (user: objWithName) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log('bye bye')</code>
                    }</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>That has become a lot shorter and more readable. Type Aliases are very flexible, and it makes it a
                    lot easier in the long run. It also reduces code duplication which is a great benefit. </p>

                <h4>Function signature</h4>
                <p>You can also add a function signature to define out of which elements a function is made. So, for
                    example, the greet function signature below defines that the function should have two parameters
                    which, in this case, should both be strings and it will return void. De function is written out
                    below the signature.
                    <code>
                    <code>let greetUser: (a: string, b: string) => void;</code>
                    <code>greetUser = (name: string, greeting: string) => {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log(name, 'says', greeting)</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>

                <h3>Interacting with the DOM</h3>
                <p>Similar as with JavaScript you can interact with the DOM in TypeScript. You can query elements,
                    update the HTML and add event listeners. However, there are some differences. The first being to
                    query elements. In this example, I am selecting all anchor elements and logging them in the console.
                    This works fine, but when I try to log a property of the anchor tag like the href I’ll get an error.
                    TypeScript tells us that our request might be <code class="inline">null</code>. This is because
                    TypeScript doesn’t
                    have access to our HTML, so it doesn’t know for sure that there is an anchor tag present and
                    therefore it is warning us that the result might be null. </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Now, I must say when I was testing this theory, I didn’t get an error but I included it
                        nevertheless because the theory behind it is sound and good to know.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    <code>
                    <code>const anchor = document.querySelector('a');</code>
                    <code>console.log(anchor.href);</code>
                    </code>
                    To make sure the query has a value, you can add an if statement like below to be sure it’s not null
                    and avoid errors.

                    <code>
                    <code>if (anchor) {</code>
                    <code class="indent">console.log(anchor.href);</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Another way, when you are 100% sure that the query selector does hold a value, you can add an
                    exclamation mark at the end of the query selector like this:
                    <code>const anchor = document.querySelector('a')!;</code>
                </p>
                <p>Another benefit of TypeScript is that it holds a special type for every DOM element. When you hover
                    over your variable that hold a query selector, it tells you what special type it has. In our case,
                    it holds an anchor element and it tells us the following:
                    <code class="inline">const anchor: HTMLAnchorElement</code>. This means that TypeScript knows this
                    variable is an
                    anchor HTML element and it gives us access to all it’s properties and methods. So in VSCode, when we
                    hover over this variable we will get a suggestion list with all its properties and methods.
                </p>

                <h4>Type Casting</h4>
                <p>When you query select a class, however, it doesn’t save the special type of that element to your
                    variable. But no worries, you can add it yourself by using Type Casting. You can add this special
                    type by saying what type of element that variable is by using the <code class="inline">as</code>
                    word. Here below
                    you can find an example of this.
                    <code>const anchorClass = document.querySelector('.anchorElement') as HTMLAnchorElement;</code>
                </p>
                <p>Using this method, I will still get all the benefits of the list with all methods and properties for
                    an anchor element while targeting the class.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Knowing these basics will get you started with TypeScript. We learned what strict types are, and how
                    they are being used by TS and how we can explicitly add types to variables without any values. We
                    also learned that we could use multiple types in a variable if we use union types and how to use
                    these types in functions. All this to write cleaner code and reduces duplicate code while following
                    a new set of rules. Because of this, we are less prone to errors and often we will notice the errors
                    when we are compiling. To end the basics, we dove into interacting with the DOM to get us really
                    started with creating an application using TypeScript. I have learned a lot from following The Net
                    Ninja tutorials on YouTube and if you want to know more about TypeScript, I recommend watching his
                    videos because I haven’t covered all of it in these basics. I enjoyed learning TypeScript and its
                    benefits, now all I need is a new project!</p>
