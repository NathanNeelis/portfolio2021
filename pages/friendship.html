                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Friendship is a dating service, not meant for romantic relationships but for friendships. Do you
                    feel
                    alone sometimes and would you like to get in touch with people that have the same interests as
                    you?
                    Then Friendship is here to help! With friendship you’ll create a profile with your interests,
                    for
                    example, going to the gym, playing board games, or videogames, or gardening. After you have
                    created
                    your profile, you’ll be able to search other profiles for specific interests. Let’s say you
                    would
                    like to play a board game, in the filter function you will let our database know to filter out
                    people that are also interested in board games. When you find some suitable matches based on
                    age,
                    location, you can get in contact with other “board gamers” and see if they’re up for a game.

                <h3>Job story</h3>
                <h5>Filtering</h5>
                <p> When I'm bored at home, at the beginning of the evening, watching cooking shows on Netflix,
                    while
                    I'm already done with all my homework
                    I want to find people that have the same interests as me
                    So I can ask them if they want to do something fun that is in both our interests.
                </p>


                <h5>Login / register</h5>
                <p> When I am sitting at home all alone, I want to be able to create an account with ease at a
                    dating
                    website to be able to match with other people and finally find someone So I won't feel alone
                    anymore. I want to be able to do this from anywhere and any device, and also with as little
                    effort
                    as possible
                </p>
                <h5>Matching</h5>
                <p>
                    When I am at home in the evening with my laptop on the couch and see a profile of a person that
                    I
                    like, I want to have a reason to talk to her. When she also likes me I would like to discuss
                    philosophical questions So we can get to know each other better and might get to a relationship.

                <h3>The application</h3>
                <h5>Homepage</h5>
                <p>On the homepage, you see some other users that you might like.
                    Depending on the weather there is a suggestion section that suggests finding people to sport
                    with if
                    the weather is nice or people to play some games with if the weather is not so good. This is
                    done by
                    checking the location of the registered user and referring it to the weather in his town via an
                    API.
                </p>

                <h5>Log in</h5>
                <p>If you want to use our application, you have to log in! This can be done via the login form. It
                    checks the email and the hashed password with the database. If it matches the user gets logged
                    in,
                    if not, then he might need to create an account.

                <p>If you want to find other users by their interest you can type in the activity you would like to
                    find
                    someone for on the search page. Our search engine will show you the results of matching profiles
                    for

                <p>If you found someone that you would like to befriend, meet, or participate with for an activity
                    you
                    can like that user. Simply by going to their profile and hitting the like button!

                <h5>It's a match!</h5>
                <p>When you both have liked each other then you have been matched. Your profiles will show up on
                    both of
                    your matches pages and when you go to the profile there is an option to get in contact.

                <h3>API</h3>
                <p>On our homepage there is also a suggestion section on what kind of people to find. I made this
                    section using a weather API.
                    if the weather is nice, it offers people to match that like doing sports. If the weather is not
                    so
                    good, it offers people that like playing games.

                <h3>Deployment</h3>
                <p>To finish this project, the application has to go live. But since there is a lot of backend
                    Javascripting involved you can't just copy it on to a server. You need to rent a server and
                    install
                    nodeJS on it. By doing this the server also is able to install all used packages and make the
                    website working. I used the services of Digital Ocean for this. And our website can be seen and
                    used
                    on by clicking on the link below. </p>

                <p>Look around and use the friendship application. If you really do not want to register you can use
                    the
                    following login:
