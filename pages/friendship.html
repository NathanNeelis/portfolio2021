                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was about creating a dynamic web application for a dating service with Node.js, a
                    database, HTML, CSS, and client-side JS. In the first part of the project I worked solo and did
                    research on existing dating apps, I also had to come up with a job story. Knowing where the focus of
                    my project lay, I had to sketch components within my job story and start working on building a
                    working prototype using skills acquired in the backend and frontend courses. In the second part of
                    the project, I teamed up with 2 other students to combine our job stories and create a prototype
                    with more functionalities.

                <p>
                    Friendship is a dating service, not meant for romantic relationships, but for friendships. Do you
                    feel alone sometimes and would you like to get in touch with people that have the same interests as
                    you? Then Friendship is here to help! With friendship you’ll create a profile with your interests,
                    for example, going to the gym, playing board games, videogames or gardening. After you have created
                    your profile, you’ll be able to search other profiles for specific interests. Let’s say you would
                    like to play a board game. The filter function will let you use our database to find other board
                    game players by filtering out people with the same interests. When you find some suitable matches
                    based on age or location, you can get in contact with other “board gamers” and see if they’re up for
                    a game.

                <h3>Suggestions based on the weather</h3>
                <p>On the homepage, you see some other users that you might like.
                    Depending on the weather there is a suggestion section that suggests finding people to sport
                    with if
                    the weather is nice or people to play some games with if the weather is not so good. This is
                    done by
                    checking the location of the registered user and referring it to the weather in his town via an
                    API.
