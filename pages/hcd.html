                <h1>Project: <span>Creating a podcast with exclusive design</span></h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                <h2>Exclusive Design</h2>
                <p>Exclusive design is designing for the needs of a specific person. This person may have or may not
                    have a disability to take into account. In making an exclusive design you take a very close look at
                    the person you are designing for, what obstacles does this person have in using a similar design /
                    service. Exclusive design is person specific, a lot of people may have the same disability but the
                    way they cope with is usually unique. This does not mean that what works for this specific person
                    doesn't work for other people, but it doesnt mean it will either. To find out, simply test it! And
                    thats what I'm going to do in this project.
                </p>

            <article>
                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p>In this project we got to work with 'real' person that has a 'real' disability. I got to work with
                    Darice and she is deaf. The assignment was to get to know Darice and create a fitting solution for
                    podcasts. To create an exclusive deisgn, I had to find out how she uses podcast at this moment and
                    how I can improve this experience.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Darice & Podcasts</h2>
                <p>As mentioned before, Darice has lost her ability to hear sound. This means that she has experienced
                    sound before but lost it during her lifetime. I was suprised that in our meetings our part of the
                    conversation got translated by a typing tolk that transfered our audio speech into text, but Darice
                    was able to respond to that by speaking through her mic. This made testing very smooth and she got
                    all her feedback over to me loud and clear! Darice is a frontend-developer and much more than that.
                    Because she is also an expert on accessiblity and exclusive design. She knows all about design
                    principles and this shows in testing with prototypes. In our first meeting my suspicion was
                    confirmed, she doens't listen to podcast but she reads the transcriptions. You might say, ofcourse
                    she does that! But if exclusive design has thought me anything, it is that you always have to verify
                    your thoughs because it might very well be different with this particulair person. Some other points
                    of interest in getting to know Darice was that she has a love for the tv-show 'Friends' and has a
                    very good sense of humor.</p>

                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <h3>Font & sizes</h3>
                <p> In the podcast you can change the font, font-size and lineheight. I tested this with Darice to find
                    out which font-size and linehieght she prefers while reading.
                    Turned out, she prefered to have the controls.
                </p>

                <h3>Simulating a podcast</h3>
                <p>I was looking for a wow-factor, because just plain text but nicely designed was
                    still just a bunch of text and you might as well read an article or an interview. I came up with an
                    idea to simulate a podcast with text. My idea was to show dialogs over time so you would get the
                    podcast feeling. The test went smooth and Darice liked the idea, it needed some tweeks in the end
                    though.
                </p>

                <h3>Nuances</h3>
                <p>
                    I wanted to dive abit deeper in nuances. How can I show context she can't hear or read? For example
                    silences during the podcast. Those arent usually in the transcript, but give context to the
                    situation and Darice tolled me in an earlier meeting she wanted to see the mistakes made in speech
                    in the transcripts. So the 'ehhssss' and the double words when someone is stuck in their talking
                    progress. I though adding silences to the transcription would fit this though process.
                </p>

                <h3>The Final Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    The final solution is an podcast that you can personalize with a font to your liking, and the
                    prefered font-size and lineheight.
                    You can read the podcast at the same speed as it is being spoken and there are added nuances to the
                    text being spoken, like being suprised or silences.
                    I also added speaker icons that are animated with an lip sync, this way its easy to see who does te
                    talking.
