                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p>
                    Out of a few projects I choose the Spotify project. In this project, I designed an experience for
                    Spotify at a music event. This experience is an additional service for Spotify especially made for
                    the needs of the real 'music freaks'. In the end, I had to deliver an interactive digital component
                    together with a physical component.
                </p>

            <article class="description">
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Buddify is made for music freaks that want to share their passion for their Idol. In the app, you
                    can share your thoughts and ideas on a forum where other music freaks are happy to participate in
                    discussions. At festivals, you can see how many of the music freaks are nearby and get matched. This
                    is where the physical component comes in, it helps guide you to your match. Once you've found each
                    other you can enjoy the festival together and expand your friendship.

                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <h3>Music freak</h3>
                <p>
                    At the start off this project I researched the music freak. What or who would be the definition of a
                    music freak? To better understand the target audience, I created a persona named Jake as a
                    guideline. Jake is not just a music freak, but a Belieber. For those that are unknown with this
                    term, a Belieber is someone crazy about his idol Justin Bieber. And thus a perfect example to focus
                    my project on
                </p>
                <img src="../images/buddify/persona.jpg" alt="Persona Jake">

                <h3>Storyboard</h3>
                <p>This whole concept is about the story of Jake. Read below of how Buddify changed Jake's life.</p>
                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard1.jpg" alt="Illustration of Jake">
                <p>This is Jake. Jake represents my target audience during this storyboard.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard2.jpg" alt="Jake is listening to Justin Bieber music">
                <p>Jake is always listening to the music of Justin Bieber. There is not a day that goes by that he
                    doesn’t turn on some of his hits.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard3.jpg" alt="Jake imitates Bieber">
                <p>Jake is even that big a fan that he imitates Biebers lifestyle. Nowadays he has the same haircut and
                    wears the same clothing.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard4.jpg" alt="Jake browsing on forums">
                <p>Just listening to Biebers hits isn’t enough for Jake. He wants to share his opinion with other
                    Beliebers on forums and isn’t afraid to participate in discussions.
                </p>


                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard5.jpg" alt="Jake on festival">
                <p>Whenever there is a festival where Justin Bieber will be performing, Jake makes sure he is attending!
                </p>


                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard6.jpg"
                    alt="Jake trying to converse with other people on the festival">
                <p>At these festivals, Jake would like to meet other Beliebers, but he is afraid to just start talking
                    to random people. And when he tries, well... It's a bunch of stutters and incoherent speech. More
                    often than not this ends in an eyebrow turned up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That is why I am introducing Buddify! Buddify is an app where you can start topics on a forum about
                    your idols and share your opinion. There is even an option to make and share vlogs about your
                    favorite subject. You can also befriend other fans in this app and become 'buddies'.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard8.jpg" alt="Mobile phone with the buddify me option">
                <p>
                    In this app you can use the function 'buddify me' and you will be matched to a fellow belieber or
                    any other idol you like.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard9.jpg" alt="Example buddify me bracelet">
                <p>
                    On the bracelet, you will see a compass. Just follow the green arrow, while at the same time your
                    match will follow theirs and you will meet up in the middle somewhere. Whenever you are near, you
                    will be able to see each other's profile pictures so you can recognize your match.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard10.jpg" alt="Jake meeting his match Els">
                <p>Jake meets his match, Els. This time is not so socially awkward because they meet for a reason.
                    During this meeting, they talk all about Bieber.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/buddify/storyboard11.jpg" alt="Jake keeps in touch with Els">
                <p>After their meet-up Jake and Els become buddies!
