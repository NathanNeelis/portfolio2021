                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p>Hipper supports rehabilitation patients by measuring their movement and visualizing this data in a
                    dashboard. Research shows that most users have trouble interpreting the information about their
                    rehabilitation progress. I will be designing a new dashboard for Hipper that visualizes this
                    information in a more user-friendly way. Apart from the data visualization, I am going to research
                    how I can motivate the patient to move more often and add this solution to the new application.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hipper is a device that is based on sensor technology (IoT device) that helps the user with the
                    rehabilitation process. The device, called a PAM device, registers movement and sends this data to a
                    server. This data is visualized in the Hipper dashboard. In this project, I will do research to find
                    a better way to visualize this data and how this can be communicated to the target audience. I will
                    also be looking for a solution on how to motivate this target audience to start moving more often
                    without getting demotivated.

                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>Hipper 2.0 is an application that can be installed on most devices and accessed on all devices. In
                    this application, you can track your activities to reach your goals. These activities and goals can
                    later be accessed in an overview. Based on your scores you can adjust your goals with your therapist
                    and plan new activities for the coming week.

                <h3>Login & register</h3>
                <p>To secure the user's data he will need to log in. If the user doesn't have an account yet, he can
                    register himself.
                </p>

                <h3>Daily- and weekly goals</h3>
                <p>Through movement with the PAM device, you will increase your score in your daily and weekly goals.
                    You can do activities that have been suggested to you by your therapist. The goal reaches 100% if
                    your score is higher than the average of all your daily scores + 1 or higher than your manually set
                    goal. Don’t be afraid to reach a higher score than 100% because it will still count in your daily
                    score!
                </p>

                <h3>Start an activity</h3>
                <p>
                    Are you going to do an activity? Start this activity in the renewed hipper app. By doing this the
                    app registers out of which activities your movement that day exists. This might come in handy when
                    you have an appointment with your therapist, and you can show which activities you have done instead
                    of relying on your memory. Another benefit is that you will see which score your activities get.

                <p>
                    On your appointment with your therapist, you can plan activities for the coming week together. This
                    way you can’t forget which activities you planned for today and motivates you in completing them.

                    Having trouble with completing your daily and weekly goals? Or are they too easy? You can adjust
                    them together with your therapist to a more realistic goal that helps you with your rehabilitation
                    process.

                <p>
                    On some devices, you can install this app. Installing this application makes for easy access because
                    you won’t have to open your browser every time. You can also access pages offline after you have
                    visited them. They will contain the latest data from when you did have an internet connection. This
                    makes visiting the Therapist easier because you can take your tablet with you and show your
                    rehabilitation progression while not having access to their Wi-Fi.
