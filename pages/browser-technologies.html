                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p>During this project we took a closer look at progressive enhancement.
                    This ment we took a close look at the three layers that are central in progressive enhancement:
                <ol>
                    <li>Functional/reliable layer</li>
                    <li>Usable layer</li>
                    <li>Pleasurable layer</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>1. Functional / reliable layer</h3>
                <p>The reliable layer is the layer that always should work. No matter the circumstances. In this layer
                    the core functionalities are the most important.</p>

                <h3>2. Usable layer</h3>
                <p>The usable layer is where design meets the user.
                    Think about information hierarchy and ordening.
                    Just keep the accessibility in mind while doing so.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Pleasurable layer</h3>
                <p>This is the layer where you can add functionalities that make the use of the application easier and
                    more fun.
                    But these are by no means neccesary. Just keep in mind, if the function fails in a browser, the user
                    should still be able to complete his task.
                </p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This app is an online photo album. In the app you can scroll through all the uploaded images. You can
                    view all the details by clicking on the image which will send you to the detail page. Also in this
                    app you can make a selection of photo's to add to a serie and view this serie as a slideshow or in a
                    carousel. Do you want your images added to this app? Simply upload them! Made a mistake? Go to the
                    detailed page to edit its content.

                <h2>Core functionalities</h2>
                <p>I choose for the assignment to create an photoalbum.
                    In the list below I listed which core functionalities are needed in this project.
                <ul>
                    <li>Overview page with all the photographs</li>
                    <li>Detail page for each photograph with meta info</li>
                    <li>Upload a photo to the overview page</li>
                    <li>Add photo's to a series</li>
                    <li>Overview page with photo's in a serie</li>
                    <li>Edit meta information of a photograph</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="highlightArticle hipper">
                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <h3>Progressive enhancement</h3>
                <p>The photo album is still useable if the user is not able to use JavaScript or CSS.
                    I made sure all functionalities still work. In the image below you see the detail page of a Photo
                    where you are still able to add the photo to your series and edit its meta data.
                </p>
                <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112503878-9550c080-8d8b-11eb-875d-ef767f1ce8df.gif"
                    alt="Detail page without CSS and Javascript">

                <h3>Responsive</h3>
                <p>Another way to improve the usability is making sure the photo album is responsive. By adding
                    flex-boxes and grid lay-outs the album already becomes very responsive. But since I used a row
                    lay-out for my overview pages I had to write some media queries to scale the amount of rows. Ofcours
                    this is done from a mobile-first point of view.</p>
                <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112499352-ac8daf00-8d87-11eb-9470-30447db89c1b.png"
                    alt="iphone view of the homepage">

                <h3>Geolocation</h3>
                <p>Adding an geolocation option is very close to the pleasurable layer, but in this use case I actually
                    think its still in the usable layer. Using geolocation you can add your location in the meta info
                    without even thinking about where you are at the moment. As the most beautifull images are mostly
                    made abroad and sometimes deep in nature, this option is very usable. I will explain more about how
                    this feature works in the browser testing tab, but in the gif below you can see that just by hitting
                    the icon your location gets added in the input field.</p>
                <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112505114-c1207600-8d8c-11eb-8340-561250e8df22.gif"
                    alt="Using geolocation to add your location of the photograph">

                <h3>Drag and drop</h3>
                <p>Looking through your photographs, you finally find the one that you would like to upload. Hitting the
                    browse button lets you search your file all over again. This can be a very frustrating experience.
                    Using this drag and drop feature, you can just grab your file and drop it into the dropzone. And if
                    you're not at home and on a mobile device, you can just click on the dropzone and even choose
                    between taking a new photograph or selecting one in your files. The orignal method works just as
                    well, because, you can actually drag and drop onto a original input field with the file type. But
                    not many people know it, and you can't really style the element and tell the user you can. That is
                    why this is in the pleasurable layer.</p>
