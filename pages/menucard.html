                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to dive into CSS. The assignment was to style the HTML of a menu card,
                    like a zen garden type of assignment. I had to choose between requirements and chose for “a
                    responsive layout without media queries” and “Completely accessible according to the AAA WCAG
                    terms”.
                </p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been using CSS for a few years already, but I never knew that you could so much with it. In
                    the last few years the development CSS has been booming. During this project, I discovered a variety
                    of new CSS techniques which will change the way I style my digital components in the future.
                </p>

            <article class="highlightArticle">
                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    First off, I learned about the skip to content button. In this menu, I applied a skip to desserts
                    button. Secondly, I added links to the headings which made it possible to tab through the menu cards
                    dishes. The elements change on tabbing because I used the focus-within pseudo-class. To emphasize
                    where you are on the page, I used a highlighted color on all focused elements with a high contrast.
                </p>

                    alt="Accessibility display with skip to sweets button and focus styles">


                <h3>Animation</h3>
                <p>
                    When you click on the clip from the clipboard the menu falls off. After some time, a waiter will
                    come and ask you if you would like a new menu. If you do, he will run off and get you a new one.
                </p>

                    alt="Loosing the menu card, waiter appears to ask if you want a new menu">

                <h3>Clamp()</h3>
                <p>
                    Clamp was a new technique for me that I hadn’t worked with before. I got very excited when I learned
                    how to use it. In my menucard, I used this technique for the font size. Setting a minimum, optimal
                    and maxium font size all in one go.
                </p>

                <h3>Calc()</h3>
                <p>
                    Using Calc was also new for me, just like clamp, I didn’t even know it was out there. But now that I
                    know, I am using it a lot! For example, to calculate the padding or to position something right in
                    the middle. Now I just put it in one line of code and don’t have to calculate it myself anymore.
                </p>

                <h3>Custom properties</h3>
                <p>
                    I always thought custom properties where part of a pre-compressor like SCSS. During this coarse I
                    learned that these custom properties are available in regular CSS. Ever since, I am using these in
                    all my projects. Although I am just using them to define colors and fonts I will learn more usecases
                    for them in the future.
                </p>

                <h3>Dark mode</h3>
                <p>
                    This website also changes to darker colors in case someone prefers dark mode. For most of the
                    website I only had to change the custom properties to darker colors. Though there where some
                    exceptions where I had to manually change the colors.
                </p>
