                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project is to dive into CSS. The assignment was to style the HTML of a menu card,
                    like a zen garden type of assignment. I had to choose between requirements and choose for “a
                    responsive layout without media queries” and “Completely accessible according to the AAA WCAG
                    terms”.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="description">
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I used CSS for a few years already, but I never knew that you could so much with it. Apparently, the
                    last few years have been booming for the progress of CSS. In this project I discovered a variety of
                    new CSS techniques which will change the way I style my digital components forever.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="highlightArticle">
                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>First off, I learned about the skip to content button. In this menu I applied a skip to desserts
                    button. Secondly, I added links to the headings. This way you can tab through the menu cards dishes.
                    The elements change on tabbing because I used the focus-within pseudo class. To emphasize where you
                    are on the page, I used a highlighted colour that I use for every accessibility part.
                </p>

                    alt="Accessibility display with skip to sweets button and focus styles">


                <h3>Animation</h3>
                <p>When you click on the clip from the clipboard the menu falls off. When you wait a while, a waiter
                    will come and ask you if you would like a new menu. If you do, he will run off and get you a new
                    one.
                </p>
                <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/109667973-fc0a0200-7b70-11eb-8780-e28bfd4651a8.gif"
                    alt="Loosing the menu card, waiter appears to ask if you want a new menu">

                <h3>Clamp()</h3>
                <p>Using clamp was totally new for me. And WOW!.. What an amazing technique. In my menu card I used this
                    technique for the font-size. Setting a minimum optimal and maximum font-size all in one go.
                </p>

                <h3>Calc()</h3>
                <p>Using Calc was also new for me, just like clamp, I didn’t even know it was out there. But now I know,
                    I am using it a lot! For example, to calculate the padding or to position something right in the
                    middle. Now I don’t have to calculate this myself anymore, just put it in one line of code.
                </p>

                <h3>Custom properties</h3>
                <p>I had seen custom properties before, but I always though they where the result of a precompressor
                    like SCSS. So, I never got into it. But since this course, all has been revealed. Custom properties
                    are awesome! Still, I have to get used to working with them, and find the extend to what is possible
                    with it. In this assignment, I used basic custom properties to get familiar with them.
                </p>

                <h3>Darkmode</h3>
                <p>This website also changes to darker colors incase someone prefers the darkmode. For the most part of
                    the website I only had to change the custom properties to darker colors. But on some points I had to
                    manually change some colors around.
                </p>
